                <p>
                    During the peak of COVID, CoxHealth released a COVID
                    screening section to their SafeApp for their employees. I
                    found a few accessibility issues with the original app, so I
                    built a webpage to correct the issues I saw.

                    One of the main assignments from the Web Development boot
                    camp I took was to build a Scrabble scoring program using
                    JavaScript. I took a part of my program from that, expanded
                    it, and built a page using Angular that allows up to four
                    people to score a game of Scrabble correctly, including
                    bonuses.

                    non-profit startup.
